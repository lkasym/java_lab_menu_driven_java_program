# java_lab_menu_driven_java_program




## Description

 This project showcases various methods to handle user input in Java. It includes examples of using `Scanner`, `BufferedReader`, `DataInputStream`, and `Console` for input and demonstrates calculating the factorial of a given number.

## Features

- Multiple input methods:
  - `Scanner`
  - `BufferedReader`
  - `DataInputStream`
  - `Console`
- Factorial calculation
- Command line argument support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or install it using a package manager for your operating system.



### Running the Program

Compile the Java files:

```bash
javac InputProcessor.java InputDemoMain.java
```

Run the main class:

```bash
java InputDemoMain
```

Optionally, you can pass a number as a command line argument to directly calculate its factorial:

```bash
java InputDemoMain [number]
```

## Usage

After running the program, follow the on-screen instructions to select an input method and enter a number for which you want to calculate the factorial.
